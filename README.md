# dpx_calc
Requires EasyGUI
Super basic, right now only calculates 10 and 16 bit. Should work OK I think!??? <br>
One advantage that this has over other online calculators is that it rounds up bit-depths not divisible by 8. Eg 10-bit RGB is calculated as 30 bits in most calculators, but this is stored as 32 bits on a hard drive.
